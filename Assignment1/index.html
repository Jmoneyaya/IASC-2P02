        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p> Within this cave there are poor souls who have been bound to the wall for their entire lives, eyes never getting to see the outside world. Only being able to gaze upon the wall in front of them, their tired eyes never leaving it. Their only source of entertainment being the shadows that often appeared on that cave wall. As of right now, they can see what looks like to be a stick floating in the air. They believe it to be magic as it is not being held up by any kind of support. But upon closer inspection, subtle changes begin to emerge. Within the blink of an eye that stick seemed to have <span class="clickable" id="first-change">turned into a doughnut in the sky.</span> The people in the cave watch as the doughnut closes on itself going back into its original stick form. Then it opens back up, continuing this loop. These movements provide vast amounts of entertainment for the cave dwellers as these shadows are the closest thing they will get to being free in the outside world.  To the cave dwellers, these changes are not merely tricks of the light but omens of a world beyond their own, a world where shadows hold secrets and mysteries waiting to be unravelled. </p>

        <p>Nick Sousanis's concept of Flatness calls into question conventional ideas of perception and comprehension, pushing us to take into account the constraints placed on us by our own points of view. Essentially, flatness is the tendency to see the world as two-dimensional, with surface characteristics controlling depth and complexity instead of perception. It's an inclination to prioritize oversimplified interpretations above the complexity and subtlety of our environment. In my opinion, flatness is a metaphor for a certain type of intellectual laziness—a refusal to see past appearances and face the complexity of reality. This idea of Flatness is embodied in the cave dwellers' perception of the shadows. They are blind to the complex interaction of light and shadow that produces the illusion in front of them; all they perceive is the surface of the cave wall. Their worldview is based on a skewed perception of cause and consequence and is influenced by superstition and fear. They are happy to cling to their limited views of the world, unable to see the deeper realities concealed under the shadows. So, when the image of the wall  <span class="clickable" id="second-change">teleports away the cave dwellers believe the doughnut is leaving, never to return. Only for it to show up again,</span> entering from the left and leaving out the right. Being fooled repeatedly that their one source of the outside world is permanently gone. The inhabitants of the cave represent Sousanis's idea of Flatness in this way because they are imprisoned in a limited perspective of reality that prevents them from seeing its full richness and depth.

        <h2>2. Seeing Double.</h2>

        <p>Beyond the cave's walls, beneath the wide open sky, the landscape takes on a clarity and perspective that people within cannot reach. Here, the intricate details of the doughnut and light sources that throw shadows on the cave wall are revealed. A lone item, a floating disk or maybe a flying saucer, the soft touch of the sun defining its features. Whether it's the sun or another celestial body, the light source is a bright pink, casting a warm glow across the landscape, creating shadows that resemble a doughnut coming in through one end to leave out the other. This process infinitely repeating itself only starts on a different side each time. In reality, the floating disk is merely flying across a horizontal plane, travelling right then left. This process continues until the strange object just <span class="clickable" id="third-change">stops</span> mid motion, floating their in the around although the spinning motion seems to carry on 
        <p>

        <p>Nick Sousanis's concept of Seeing Double challenges us to consider multiple perspectives simultaneously, recognizing that truth is often multifaceted and complex. Seeing Double means acknowledging the existence of parallel narratives, each offering its own unique insights and interpretations. It is the recognition that reality is not fixed or absolute but rather fluid and dynamic, shaped by the interplay of countless individual perspectives. When we compare and contrast the views of the people inside the cave with those outside, we see a stark contrast in worldview. The people inside, limited by their narrow surroundings, see only the shadows on the cave wall, interpreting them through the lens of superstition and fear. In contrast, those outside perceive the scene in its entirety, recognizing the interconnectedness of light, shadow, and object. By combining both views, we gain a deeper understanding of the larger process at play—the intricate dance of light and shadow, object and observer. On the outside of the cave, you are able to recognise that when the object displayed on the wall  <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">seems to move towards the ceiling, </span>the reality is it never moves. In fact, the sun is setting down on the horizon, not to be seen again until morning. We see that the shadow, the object, and the light are not isolated phenomena but rather integral components of a larger, interdependent whole.
