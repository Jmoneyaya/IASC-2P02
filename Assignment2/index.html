    <h1>The Hunger Games</h1>

    <h2>Jamelia Lucienbaker</h2>

    <p> The story "The Hunger Games", follows the main character Katniss. She is a very protective, loyal and strong protagonist. Her loyalty and protectivness are shown through her relationships of those close to her which is demonstrated in part 1. The story is mostly composed of the intensely emotional bond that exists between Katniss and Primrose. Many of Katniss's decisions throughout the series are motivated by her intense love and protectiveness for her sister, especially when it comes to her choice to compete in the Hunger Games as a tribute rather than Prim. Primrose’s presence is only in the beginning of the book when Katniss is still in district 12, resulting in her name mostly being at the bottom of the clump. . Though she is still kept in Katniss’s thoughts, so her name is still visible throughout. The bond between family does not falter due to physical closeness.
 
    </p>

    <p> Next is Gale, their common struggles with survival and resistance against the repressive Capitol serve as the foundation for Katniss and Gale's bond. Their shared awareness of the hard reality of living in District 12 and their desire to keep their loved ones safe are what cement their relationship.
        Gales name is seen throughout but as the narrative goes on, their connection gets more convoluted, especially once the third main character in the tale, Peeta Mellark, is introduced. His name is almost constantly overshadowed by Peeta’s, just like how Katniss’s love for Peeta grew as the book went on. In the end, Katniss and Gale share a close bond based on respect and familiarity but that is not on the same level as Katniss’s love for Peeta.

    <p> The relationship between Katniss and Peeta starts in the first book when Peeta openly confesses his love for her in the televised interviews leading up to the Hunger Games. 
        The friendship between Katniss and Peeta deepens throughout the narrative. Together, they overcome the obstacles of the Hunger Games and develop a close relationship based on trust, respect, and survival experiences. Peetas name is what makes up the majority of the clump, demonstrating his partnership with Katniss throughout the whole book. Being together during life-or-death situations is what creates such a strong bond. His name is constantly in Katniss’s mind after she meets him which is pretty close to the start of the story as seen in the clump. All three characters are linked due to their close bond with Katniss. She is the glue that connects their lives and stories together. This is why I chose to use a torus as my object as it looks like chains linked together when in a clump. 
        
        </p>

    <p> In the book there are 12 districts that the population are divided into as well as the capital, the main character Katniss lives in District 12. In comparison to the districts, the population of the Capitol is quite tiny. It is mostly made up of members of the ruling class, government officials, and the rich elite. Residents of the districts do not have the same access to healthcare, education, and professional possibilities as capital citizens, who also enjoy a privileged status. The bulk of this world's population resides in the districts, each of which is an industry or resource specialist. Although the district's citizens come from a variety of socioeconomic origins, they are all subject to the oppression and poverty imposed by the Capitol. Compared to the Capitol, the districts have a more diverse and greater population, with individuals engaged in manual labour, agriculture, and other essential industries.

    <p>The districts work together to highlight the world’s glaring differences and divisions. They demonstrate the brutal exploitation of the populace's labour and resources by the ruling class, as well as the Capitol's supremacy over them. The Capitol is endowed with riches, luxury, and authority, while the districts are kept in a state of permanent poverty and hardship.
        Since they have experienced similar suffering and injustice, they become more unified and supportive of one another, which inspires them to fight against the oppressive policies of the Capitol.  District 12 is mentioned more than the other districts as it is where Katniss is from, the word 12 is always next to the word district but the two words don’t consist of the same quantity. It goes to show that 12 is only one part of a whole system that had been built by the capital to control the masses. Katniss and her community aren’t the only ones who have been constantly suffering and fighting to survive, all the districts have. I decided to go with the word capital to illustrate the difference in population between the districts and the capital. Such a small population that has total power and influence, you can barely see them amongst the other two words. I have also aligned the spheres in a way so they look like a wall. This wall represents how each district was divided up into borders to weaken them. There are some gaps in the walls, those are the cracks that begin to form in the wall. Depicting the start of a revolution led by Katniss, as she goes on to change the system in the later books.
