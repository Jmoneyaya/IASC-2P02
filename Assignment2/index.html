    <h1>The Hunger Games</h1>

    <h2>Jamelia Lucienbaker</h2>

    <p> The story The Hunger Games follows the main character Katniss. She is a very protective, loyal and strong protagonist. Her loyalty and protectivness are shown through her relationships of those close to her which is demonstrated in part 1. The story is mostly composed of the intensely emotional bond that exists between Katniss and Primrose. Many of Katniss's decisions throughout the series are motivated by her intense love and protectiveness for her sister, especially when it comes to her choice to compete in the Hunger Games as a tribute rather than Prim. Primrose’s presence is only in the beginning of the book when Katniss is still in district 12, resulting in her name mostly being at the bottom of the clump. 
    </p>

    <p> Next is Gale, their common struggles with survival and resistance against the repressive Capitol serve as the foundation for Katniss and Gale's bond. Their shared awareness of the hard reality of living in District 12 and their desire to keep their loved ones safe are what cement their relationship.
        Gales name is seen throughout but as the narrative goes on, their connection gets more convoluted, especially once the third main character in the tale, Peeta Mellark, is introduced. His name is almost constantly overshadowed by Peeta’s, just like how Katniss’s love for Peeta grew as the book went on. In the end, Katniss and Gale share a close bond based on respect and familiarity but that is not on the same level as passion.

    <p> The relationship between Katniss and Peeta starts in the first book when Peeta openly confesses his love for her in the televised interviews leading up to the Hunger Games. Peeta proves his loyalty and readiness to give up everything for Katniss throughout the Games.
        The friendship between Katniss and Peeta deepens throughout the narrative. Together, they overcome the obstacles of the Hunger Games and develop a close relationship based on trust, respect, and survival experiences. Even though the Capitol tries to use their relationship for political and entertainment gain, Katniss and Peeta start to have real affections for one another. Peetas name is what makes up the majority of the clump, demonstrating his partnership with Katniss throughout the whole book. Being together during life-or-death situations is what creates such a strong bond. His name is constantly in Katniss’s mind after she meets him which is pretty close to the start of the story as seen in the clump. 
        </p>

    <p> The districts work together to highlight Panem's glaring differences and divisions. They demonstrate the brutal exploitation of the populace's labour and resources by the ruling class, as well as the Capitol's supremacy over them. The Capitol is endowed with riches, luxury, and authority, while the districts are kept in a state of permanent poverty and hardship.


        Moreover, the districts as a whole represent concepts of defiance, unity, and resilience. The residents of the districts demonstrate perseverance in the face of hardship, despite the harsh government established by the Capitol. Since they have experienced similar suffering and injustice, they become more unified and supportive of one another, which inspires them to fight against the oppressive policies of the Capitol.

    <p>Lorem
    <p>Capitol: In comparison to the districts, the population of the Capitol is quite tiny. It is mostly made up of members of the ruling class, government officials, and the rich elite. Residents of the districts do not have the same access to healthcare, education, and professional possibilities as capitol citizens, who also enjoy a privileged status. The people that live in the Capitol are diverse, coming from different origins and occupations.
        Districts: The bulk of Panem's population resides in the districts, each of which is an industry or resource specialist. Although the district's citizens come from a variety of socioeconomic origins, they are all subject to the oppression and poverty imposed by the Capitol. Compared to the Capitol, the districts have a more diverse and greater population, with individuals engaged in manual labor, agriculture, and other essential industries
